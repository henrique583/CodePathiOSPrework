# App Brainstorming
Favorite applications (in no particular order):

Duolingo
 - I love the streak feature and how it engages users to keep using the app
 - Animations in the app are usually pretty smooth and respond very well when called -great UX

YouTube
 - Great UX, everything (from loading videos to switching between tabs) is very smooth
 - Algorithm is usually pretty good at suggesting videos

Notability
 - Audio transcription tool is very accurate and allows you to see what notes you were taking when something was said
 - Ability to format pages and use templates is very helpful

Would love to build an app that helps people build habits by offering a great UX and streak feature that keeps users wanting to use the app as their
preferred method of daily habit/task checking. Also want to add the option to journal in the app.
