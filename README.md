# Prework - CodePathiOSPrework

Submitted by: Henrique Rodrigues

CodePathiOSPrework is an app that I built to practice using SwiftUI in XCode. The app is an interface that includes some basic information about me (name, college, and aspirations) with a button that changes the background color of the screen, as well as the font of my name every time you press it.

Time spent: 5 hours hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [X] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

# App Brainstorming
Favorite applications (in no particular order):

Duolingo
 - I love the streak feature and how it engages users to keep using the app.
 - Animations in the app are usually pretty smooth and respond very well when called -great UX.

YouTube
 - Great UX, everything (from loading videos to switching between tabs) is very smooth.
 - Algorithm is usually pretty good at suggesting videos.

Notability
 - Audio transcription tool is very accurate and allows you to see what notes you were taking when something was said.
 - Ability to format pages and use templates is very helpful.

Would love to build an app that helps people build habits by offering a great UX and streak feature that keeps users wanting to use the app as their.
preferred method of daily habit/task checking. Also want to add the option to journal in the app that includes journaling templates based on scientific research.
